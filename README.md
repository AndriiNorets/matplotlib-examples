TASK 1
The program generates a bar chart to visualize the distribution of wine counts based on their quality. The x-axis represents the quality values, while the y-axis represents the count of wines for each quality category. Each bar corresponds to a specific quality value and is colored according to its quality category using predefined colors. The bars have black edges to enhance visibility. The legend displays the count of wines for each quality value. This chart allows for easy comparison of wine counts across different quality categories, providing an overview of the distribution of wine quality in the dataset. The resulting chart is saved as a PNG image file named "Task1.png" and is also displayed for immediate visual inspection.

TASK 2
The program visualizes the relationship between volatile acidity and pH of wines using a scatter plot. The scatter plot helps observe the distribution of data points and identify potential correlations or patterns between these two variables. The resulting plot is saved as a JPEG image and also displayed for immediate visual examination.

TASK 3
The program visualizes the relationship between the pH, alcohol, and residual sugar content in wines using a 3D scatter plot. This plot allows observation of the distribution of data points in a three-dimensional space and identification of potential patterns or correlations among these variables. The resulting plot is displayed for immediate visual examination.

TASK 4
The program visualizes the average alcohol content between red and white wines using a bar chart. The resulting chart provides a clear comparison of the mean alcohol percentages for the two types of wines.

TASK 5
The program visualizes the distribution of the "Value" column based on the "Area" for the "Primary Market" and "Secondary Market" categories using pie charts. The resulting chart shows the proportions of different area ranges in the value distribution for each market category.

TASK 6
The program visualizes the distribution of the "Value" column for different engine capacities in the years 2018 and 2019 using pie charts. The resulting charts show the proportion of each engine capacity category in the total value for each year.

TASK 7
The program visualizes the number of transports for the "Silesian" and "Mazovian" regions over the years. The resulting bar charts provide a comparison of the number of transports for each region in different years.

TASK 8
The program visualizes the number of hotels in different regions over the years. The resulting scatter plot shows the number of hotels for each region as markers plotted against the corresponding years. Each region is represented by a different marker shape and labeled in the legend. The plot helps compare the number of hotels across different regions and observe any trends or patterns over time.

TASK 9
The program visualizes the daily exchange rate for a period of 30 days. The resulting line plot shows the trend of the exchange rate over time, with each point representing the exchange rate on a specific day. The plot helps observe any fluctuations or patterns in the exchange rate.

TASK 10
The program compares the maximum number of students in different categories (male and female) for the years 2016 and 2017. The resulting bar plots show the maximum values for each category and year, allowing for a visual comparison between the two years and the different genders.

TASK 11
The program displays two horizontal bar plots side by side. The left plot represents values_1 with corresponding labels and colors, and the right plot represents values_2 with corresponding labels and colors. The x-axis ticks are set differently for each subplot, and titles are provided for each plot. The resulting figure provides a visual comparison between the two sets of values.
