TASK 1
The result of the program is a bar chart that visualizes the distribution of wine count based on their quality. The x-axis represents the quality values, while the y-axis represents the count of wines for each quality category. Each bar in the chart corresponds to a specific quality value and is colored according to its quality category using the predefined colors. The bars have black edges to enhance their visibility. The legend displays the count of wines for each quality value. The chart provides an easy comparison of the wine count across different quality categories, giving an overview of the distribution of wine quality in the dataset. The resulting chart is saved as a PNG image file named "Task1.png" and is also displayed for immediate visual inspection.
TASK 2
The result of this program is visualization the relationship between the volatile acidity and pH of wines using a scatter plot. The scatter plot allows us to observe the distribution of data points and identify any potential correlation or patterns between these two variables. The resulting plot is saved as a JPEG image and also shown for immediate visual examination.
TASK 3
The result of this program is visualization the relationship between the content of pH, alcohol, and residual sugar in wines using a 3D scatter plot. The plot allows us to observe the distribution of data points in a three-dimensional space and identify any potential patterns or correlations between these variables. The resulting plot is shown for immediate visual examination.
TASK 4
The result of this program is visualization the average alcohol content between red and white wines using a bar chart. The resulting chart provides a clear comparison of the mean alcohol percentages for the two types of wines.
TASK 5
The result of this program is visualization the distribution of the "Wartosc" (value) column based on the "powierzchnia" (area) for the "rynek pierwotny" and "rynek wtórny" categories using pie charts. The resulting chart shows the proportions of different area ranges in the value distribution for each market category.
TASK 6
The result of this program is visualization the distribution of the "Wartosc" (value) column for different engine capacities ("pojemnosc silnika") in the years 2018 and 2019 using pie charts. The resulting charts show the proportion of each engine capacity category in the total value for each year.
TASK 7
The result of this program is visualization the number of transports ("Liczba przewozów") for the "ŚLĄSKIE" and "MAZOWIECKIE" regions over the years. The resulting bar charts provide a comparison of the number of transports for each region in different years.
TASK 8
The result of this program is visualization the number of hotels ("Liczba hoteli") in different regions ("województwa") over the years. The resulting scatter plot shows the number of hotels for each region as markers plotted against the corresponding years. Each region is represented by a different marker shape and labeled in the legend. The plot helps compare the number of hotels across different regions and observe any trends or patterns over time.
TASK 9
The result of this program is visualization the daily exchange rate ("Kurs CZK") for a period of 30 days. The resulting line plot shows the trend of the exchange rate over time, with each point representing the exchange rate on a specific day. The plot helps to observe any fluctuations or patterns in the exchange rate.
TASK 10
The purpose of this program is to compare the maximum number of students in different categories (male and female) for the years 2016 and 2017. The resulting bar plots show the maximum values for each category and year, allowing for a visual comparison between the two years and the different genders.
TASK 11
The purpose of this program is to display two horizontal bar plots side by side. The left plot represents values_1 with corresponding labels and colors, and the right plot represents values_2 with corresponding labels and colors. The x-axis ticks are set differently for each subplot, and titles are provided for each plot. The resulting figure provides a visual comparison between the two sets of values.
